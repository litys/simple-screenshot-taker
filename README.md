2. Type "shell:startup" and press enter.
3. Paste there a **shortcut** to run.pyw.
**IMPORTANT! DO NOT PASTE THERE run.pyw!** Application is creating pictures in folder where is. So paste there **only a shortcut to application**.

There is two possible options:

Interval and counter default options in 60. So application will work 3600 seconds = 60 minutes = 1 hour.
